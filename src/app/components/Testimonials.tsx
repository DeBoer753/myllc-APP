      introduced to Myles I was taken by his friendly approach and impressed with his knowledge in both web design and the internet. 
      Myles created a fantastic website for me. As a musician I had certain expectations with how I wanted to present myself.  
      Myles conveyed a confidence in how he thought the site should look with regards to my background. 
      When he finally presented my website I was thrilled! I feel proud to have this website represent me and he made the entire experience fun! 
      Communication was excellent during the entire process. I highly recommend Graybuck Media for your next website project<Text as={'span'} fontWeight={600}>&ldquo;</Text>

      We then spent many zoom calls over the course of the past year or so breaking down coding challenges, 
      creating game plans for success, and providing exposure in to the life of a developer. Each step of the way, 
      Myles had a great attitude and the unwavering drive of someone destined to be successful.<Text as={'span'} fontWeight={600}>&ldquo;</Text>
